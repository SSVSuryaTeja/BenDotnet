Looping Control Structures : 
_____________________________

while loop : This loop executes all the statements repeatedly until
condition remains true, if the condition remains false, then it comes
out of the loop. For every loop, basically there are 3 phases known as

	(i) Initialization
       (ii) Condition
      (iii) Increment/Decrement 

Initialization performed at the beginning of the loop. 

Condition performed at the conditional part of the loop. 

Increment/Decrement performed before closing the loop. 

syntax :
_________

while(condition) 
{
   statement(s);
}

Factorial of given number 

for loop : Executes the statements repeatedly until the condition remains true,
if the condition remains false, then it comes out of the loop.


for(initialization;condition;increment/decrement) 
{
  statement(s);
}

Array : 

An array is the finite ordered set of homogeneous elements, means all the 
elements belongs to same data type. 

int[] a=new int[]{12,5,6,33,55};

a[0]=12;
a[1]=5;
a[2]=6;
a[3]=33;
a[4]=55;

There are 2 types of memories as 

	1) STACK

	2) HEAP 

Value types will be stored in STACK memory, and reference types will be 
stored in HEAP memory. 

Types of Parameters : 
______________________


There are 3 types of parameters known as 

1) in : Can be used for input purpose.

2) ref : Can be used for both input/output purpose.

3) out : If you want to return more than one value then we need out.
