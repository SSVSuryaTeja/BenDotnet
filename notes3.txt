method overloading : 
_____________________

The concept of using the same method name w.r.t. Different parameters,
different data types known as method overloading. Here, the method name
must be same, but no.of parameters or type of parameters we are passing
are different. 

Constructors : 
_______________

A constructor is a special member that which used to initialize the member 
variables of the class. It is special because it has the same name
as that of class name. 

Rules : 
________

   -> It will not contains any return type. 

   -> It will not returna any value. 

   -> It will be invoked automatically once the instance of the class 
		created. 

   -> A constructor can be overloaded. 

Types of Constructors: 
_______________________

There are 2 types of constructors known as 

	(i) static constructor : It is called class constructor, it will be invoked automatically before the control reaches the entry point. We cannot overload this constructor. 

       (ii) instance constructor : These are the constructors that which are 
invoked automatically once the instance of the class created. This constructor
can be overloaded. 

static variables : 

	These are the variables that which retains values irrespective of type
of object. 


static methods : 

These the methods that which are to be called by using class name.

No object required to call these methods.
